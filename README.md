# WaverPad
A **simple** soundboard made in PascalABC.NET

It's very lightweight, lesser than 1 MB, and has all the basic functionality you would need!

By the way, I finished and released it on [my Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/michaelagarkov)!

I really hope you will find it useful for your needs!

It's distributed under the BSD 4-Clause license, so you have the freedom to release your own versions with your own modifications and features! (Just follow the EULA)

For the source code, I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
